collected all the links ( around 2000 ) using get links.py

the file -> Loksattalinks.txt consist of all the links 

The links belong to some predefined domain like :
Enterntainment , tech , lifestyle , politics , maharashtra , etc

Since I wanted data to be organises and easy to work on I decided to Store the links in different folders .
Besides it will be impossible for one person to work on entire dataset ( when we fetch data it will be humungous ) .
So organising them based on domain will be managebale as we can ask people to work on it based on their domain interest .

To achieve this -> I have created : sort_links.py 
This script sorts and stores all the links into different text files 
Thus one can later use one script - changing reference files , to scrape data .
